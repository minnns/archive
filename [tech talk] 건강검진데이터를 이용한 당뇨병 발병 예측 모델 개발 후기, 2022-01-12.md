- Perceiver
- Definition
- Perceiver is a transformer adapted to be able to process non-textual data, such as images, sounds and video, and spatial data. Transformers underlie other notable systems such as BERT and GPT-3, which preceded Perceiver.[1] It adopts an asymmetric attention mechanism to distill inputs into a latent bottleneck, allowing it to learn from large amounts of heterogeneous data. Perceiver matches or outperforms specialized models on classification tasks.
